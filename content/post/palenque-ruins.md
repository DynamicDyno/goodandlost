+++

Palenque is one of the most important Mayan ruins. The ruins date from 226 - 799 AD. I wanted to get there before the swarms of tourists, so I got up early and was waiting at the gate at 7:30am. The park doesn't open until 8, so I had some tacos for breakfast and then was the first person into the ruins. In fact, for the first hour I was pretty much the only person around. The ruins are fairly big so I didn't see anyone else until I circled back to where the entrance was. It was like being in a separate world. Just me, the ruins, and my imagination on what it must've been like to live there 1500 years ago.

One of the first things I noticed was how this was very unlike the other Mayan ruins I've been to. Whereas Teotihuacán is flat and Monte Albán is on the hills with a view that stretches for miles, Palenque is buried in jungle. Although I was alone, there was a fairly loud *buzz* the entire time I was there, presumably some kind of insects. Animals cried and howled in the thick trees that surrounded the stone temples. The soundtrack to the ruins was one of my favorite parts.

{{< zoomimage "/assets/images/posts/palenque/palenque-mexico-9.jpg" "Palenque, Mexico - The Ruins" "Most of the big buildings were temples, with either a religious purpose or in memory of one of the rulers. They made really intricate carvings for the center of the temples." >}}

Most of Palenque still hasn't been excavated yet. It's crazy to think that most of the ancient city is still underground. But what they have uncovered is great.
