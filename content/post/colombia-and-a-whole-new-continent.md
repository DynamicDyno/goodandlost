So I made it to a whole new continent, South America! Although Colombia is still almost entirely in the northern hemisphere, it's still nice to make it to what feels like a whole new world. I had been in Central America for about 8 months and I was excited to be in a whole new place. On top of that, my entire trip I had been hearing from other travelers about how awesome Colombia was. Say no more. *Listo!*
