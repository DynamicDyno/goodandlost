What in the *hell* have I been doing? It's hard to even say, and where do I begin? It's been over four months since I've written a blog post--not that that's surprising to me. Before I started my trip I knew there was a pretty good possibility this would happen. But, I figured I would man up and get it done. Looks like I was wrong!

But what I want to avoid is long-term, habit-producing lack of documentation, that would eventually lead to me forgetting much of my trip. It's been about four years since I traipsed around Europe and honestly, I've forgotten way more of it than I would like to admit. I can't even remember some of the cities I went to, and I can't remember 100% of the names of people I met unless we're still Facebook friends. How much of my first trip to Europe will I remember in 20 years?

And that's why I know it's important for me, at the very least, to archive some photos and anecdotes. So buckle up, let's post some travel stuff!

## Tulum

I left Canc√∫n in mid September and I was *excited*. I had spent nearly two months there, most of which I was waiting for a package (shipped from the United States) that was lost in the black hole of Mexican customs. After waiting and waiting and waiting, and phoning with all of the agencies involved and never receiving any kind of update on where my package was, I finally decided to leave.

Tulum is home to the famous Mayan beach ruins.

Okay, I didn't stay long in Tulum. Like I said, I was *excited*, and mostly to get out of the country. I started the trip five months prior and had so far only seen Mexico and Cuba. I had one more planned stop in Mexico, which was...

## Bacalar

Bacalar is beautiful. It's a big lake, but close to the Caribbean Ocean, and the water is *so. blue.* Unfortunately, I somehow managed to not take any pictures of Bacalar with my good camera, and the pictures I did have on my phone died along with it.

I met MJ in Bacalar, which would be the start of three months traveling together.

While we were in that particular cenote, it started raining quite hard. It was very surreal!

## T-t-t-that's all folks

I pretty much high-tailed it for Belize at this point, ready for a new stamp and a new adventure!
