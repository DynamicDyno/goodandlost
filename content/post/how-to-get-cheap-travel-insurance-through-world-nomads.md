Travel insurance is something you should probably have and hope to never have to use. Travel insurance can protect you from things such as stolen luggage and gear, canceled tickets, emergency medical visits, insanely expensive medical evacuation, and a handful of other things. <a href="https://www.worldnomads.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">World Nomads</a> is a popular option that many backpackers choose.

Since I'm about to embark on an indefinitely long world tour, I figured I should get some travel insurance and quickly settled on World Nomads. And since I plan to be gone for longer than a year, I put in a year for my coverage length (the longest they offer). I wrote down the price they quoted me ($1050 / $1333 based on which package I wanted).

Then I had doubts about doing this. What if I don't end up traveling for a full year? It would be a waste of money. It would be smart to check and see how much more it would cost to buy it in smaller increments. So I tried the same coverage for three months and the prices they quoted me seemed really low. Three months for $206 / $295. I did the math (three months x 4 = 1 year) and those prices came out to $824 / $1180. Both are significantly less than paying for a full year at once.

World Nomads seems to be ripping people off if they're careless enough to buy in bulk. I checked all of the coverage durations to see what the sweet spot would be for buying travel insurance through them.

So yeah, the sweet spot is to buy 5-6 months at a time. I'm not sure if this is an error on their part or if it is done on purpose because people assume that when you buy in quantity the price gets cheaper and cheaper. Either way, the more you know. There's no reason to buy a year at a time unless you're *really* lazy and don't want to get on their website to purchase insurance more than once a year.

Hope that helps! Let me know in the comments if you notice anything else weird about their pricing.
