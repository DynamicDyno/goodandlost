Hello! My name is Kevin Sweet and I run this blog. I caught the travel bug in 2011 when I went to Europe for the first time and have been living with the illness ever since. I spent six months living in Belgium and then backpacked around Europe the rest of the year.

I ran out of money and since I didn't have a work visa anywhere decided to return to the US to save up. I spent two and a half years working and saving, and now I'm back out on the trail again. This time I'm going to be traveling through the Americas. I'm starting in northern Mexico, and I plan to go south through all of Central and South America.

I hope this blog will be a convenient way for friends to keep up with my travels and hopefully something I write here will be helpful to someone out there.
